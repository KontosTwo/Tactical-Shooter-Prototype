NOTE: The game was reconceptualized and reimplemented in Unity and Monobehaviors (https://github.com/KontosTwo/Didymos), and then scrapped and reimplemented in Unity and ECS (private repository)

Tactical 2-D Shooter under development
- Developed in Java
- Uses the LibGDX game library for more efficient graphics rendering
