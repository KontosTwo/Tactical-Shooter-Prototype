# Didymos

NOTE: The game was reconceptualized and reimplemented in Unity and Monobehaviors (https://github.com/KontosTwo/Didymos), and then scrapped and reimplemented in Unity and ECS (private repository)

Tactical 2-D Shooter under development
- Developed in Java
- Uses the LibGDX game library for more efficient graphics rendering
- Uses Tiled to create orthogonal maps
- Uses GraphicsGale to create sprite art
- All other resources implemented by original code

Take control of two soldiers and defeat vast enemy forces in a variety of tactical scenarios. Will feature a smart, tactical behavior tree for AI and a diverse, exploitable terrain that encourages you to think tactically
